            <h1>Question : Difference between global scope and block scope</h1>
            <p>Global scope contains all of the things defined outside of all code blocks. A global variable has global scope. A global variable is accessible from anywhere in the code. On the other hand,  A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops, are accessible within that particular condition or loop. To be consise the variables declared inside the curly braces are called as within block scope.</p>

            <h1>Question: how event loop works in javascript</h1>
            <p>The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>
